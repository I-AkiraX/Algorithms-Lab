#
###### Question1: [```Answer1```](q1.c)
    ✨ Write a program to test whether a number n, entered through keyboard is prime or not by using different algorithms you know for atleast 10 inputs and note down the time complexity by step/frequency count method for each algorithm & for each input. Finally make a comparision of time complexities found for different inputs, plot an appropriate graph & decide which algorithm is faster.
#
###### Question2: [```Answer2```](q2.c)
    ✨ Write a program to find out GCD (greatest common divisor) using the following three algorithms.
            a) Euclid’s algorithm
            b) Consecutive integer checking algorithm.
            c) Middle school procedure which makes use of common prime factors. For finding list of primes implement sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.
        Write a program to find out which algorithm is faster for the following data. Estimate how many times it will be faster than the other two by step/frequency count method in each case.
