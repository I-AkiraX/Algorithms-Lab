###### Question1: [```Answer1```](q1.c)
    ✨ Compare the best case, worst case and average case time complexity of Insertion Sort on basis of Step Count Method as well as CPU clock time.
#
###### Question2: [```Answer2```](q2.c)
    ✨ Let A be a list of n (not necessarily distinct) integers. Write a program by using User Defined Function(UDF)s to test whether any item occurs more than ⌈ n/2⌉ times in A.
        a) UDF should take O(n^2) time
        b) UDF should take O(n) time
#
###### Question3: [```Answer3```](q3.c)
    ✨ Write a program by using an user defined function for computing ⌊ √n⌋ for any positive integer n. Besides assignment and comparison, your algorithm may only use the four basic arithmetical operations.
