###### Question1: [```Answer1```](q1.c)
    ✨ Write a program to search an element x in an array of n integers using binary search algorithm that uses divide and conquer technique. Find out the best case, worst case and average case time complexities for different values of n and plot a graph of the    time taken versus n. The n integers can be generated randomly and x can be chosen randomly, or any element of the array or middle or last element of the array depending on type of time complexity analysis.
#
###### Question2: [```Answer2```](q2.c)
    ✨ Write a program to sort a list of n elements using the merge sort method and determine the time required to sort the elements. Repeat the experiment for different values of n and different nature of data (random data, sorted data, reversely sorted data) in the list. n is the user input and n integers can be generated randomly. Finally plot a graph of the time taken versus n.
